analyses, compare them directly.

Produce EXACTLY three sections, in this order, with these exact headings:

## Consensus
What do all personas agree on? Be specific — name the thesis, not just "they
agreed it's a stock".

## Divergence
Where do the personas disagree, and why? This section is the most important
in the brief. Do NOT smooth over disagreement; surface it. Use this shape:
- Persona X says Y because Z. Persona A says B because C. The disagreement
  hinges on <the load-bearing assumption>.

## Recommendation
One of BUY / HOLD / SELL with a confidence rationale. If the divergence in
the previous section is material, explicitly say so and recommend HOLD with
a "low-confidence call" note.
